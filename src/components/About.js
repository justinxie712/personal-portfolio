                    My name is Justin Xie, and I develop web applications. I live in Mountain View, California, but consider many places home 
                    (Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, to name a few). Through previous internships and personal projects, I have gained experience 
                    with a variety of languages and frameworks, particularly with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
                    I work well in independent settings, as well as team-based settings. I am a quick learner, a diligent worker, an excellent problem-solver,
                    and a cooperative team player.

                    In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, playing soccer, basketball, and baseball, and
                    getting involved with my service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, as an alumnus. 
                    These personal interests of mine have instilled the values of team work and leadership 
                    throughout my personal, academic, and professional life.

const portworx_description = `  I developed a new user interface for the Portworx database, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Go. 
                                It includes a variety of analytical charts (Google Charts API) and features for data analysis. 
                                I also developed a template for the Portworx documentation webpage and demonstrated how scripts can 
                                be written to automate automate graphic and index pattern creation using ElasticSearch.`;

const cc_description       = `  This is a fun application I created in my spare time. It is a simple Caesar Cipher application that is
                                used to create ciphered texts using input text.` 

const lw_description       = `  This is another fun application I created in my spare time. I created a simulation of the classic
                                computer program, "Logo Writer", that creates images with a series of commands.` 

const nwhacks_description = `   I helped create a prototype of a social media application where users can view, submit and comment on photos. 
                                The user interface was implemented using Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS3, while the back-end used Node.js. It is used to produce 
                                a dashboard of submissions on home page with data of user submissions. I also incorporated Google Maps API and location tracking 
                                to display submissions from neighbouring areas.`;

const cpsc310_description = `   I implemented a query engine that performs simulated tasks and enables effective querying of the schoolâ€™s metadata (courses, room scheduling, class averages, etc.)
                                Through this project, I learned RESTful design, proper code refactoring techniques, asynchronous development, and object-oriented design methods.
                                I also learned Agile development, unit testing, and high and low-level design.`;

const music_libary_description = `  I helped develop an interactive interface for a standard music library using HTML5 and PHP.
                                    We used an Oracle database to store customer transactions, personal information, etc., and queried from the database using SQLPlus.`;

const patternex_description = ` I wrote a script with Python that automates stress tests on Apache Cassandra nodes.
                                This script produces a performance report of Apache Cassandra nodes, which is used to
                                analyze the results of the stress tests and to identify anomalies.`;
